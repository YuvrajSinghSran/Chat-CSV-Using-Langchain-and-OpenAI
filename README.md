# Chat-CSV-Using-Langchain-and-OpenAI
This cutting-edge project leverages LangChain, a groundbreaking framework designed for building language model-driven applications. At its core, LangChain enables seamless communication between users and text files through a chat interface powered by OpenAI's language models. By integrating with various data sources, the application fosters interaction with its environment, adhering to the principles of the LangChain framework. Users can effortlessly upload text files, which are then processed and stored in an in-memory database, forming the foundation for engaging conversations via the AI-powered chat interface.

Streamlit serves as the platform for delivering this innovative solution, offering a user-friendly and efficient experience for showcasing the application's functionality. With LangChain, an in-memory database, and Streamlit, this project exemplifies the convergence of cutting-edge technologies to create a seamless and immersive user experience.
